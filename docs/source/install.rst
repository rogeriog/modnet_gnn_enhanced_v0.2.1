Installation
============

MODNet can be installed via pip::

    pip install modnet

It is recommended to use a separate virtual environment for modnet (with conda or venv).

We strongly recommend pinning your Python environment when using MODNet
across multiple machines, or multiple MODNet versions, as changes to the
dependencies and sub-dependencies can lead to different values for particular
features.

This can be achieved with ``conda export`` or `pip freeze``.
